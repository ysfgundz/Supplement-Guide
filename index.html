                Fitness gurus and blogs touting these products as crucial for peak performance, fat loss, 
                and explosive muscle growth in combination with complicated scientific-sounding names and labels might have you believing you can’t effectively exercise without them.
                Although supplements are not so vital, their use can be of great benefit to your physique.

            <header>Whey Protein</header>
            <p>Recommended levels of daily protein intake for the general population (0.8 grams of protein for every kilogram of body weight, or about 7 grams of protein every day for every 20 pounds of body weight) are estimated to be sufficient to meet the needs of nearly all healthy adults. [25] Recommendations for protein supplementation during exercise vary based on the type of exercise being conducted: endurance training (e.g., long-distance bicycling) or resistance training (e.g., weight lifting). Very few studies have investigated the effects of prolonged protein supplementation on endurance exercise performance. A review conducted by the International Society of Sports Nutrition found that protein supplementation in the presence of adequate carbohydrate intake does not appear to improve endurance performance, but may reduce markers of muscle damage and feelings of soreness. </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Carbohydrate">
            <header>Carbohydrate</header>
            <p>Replenishing glycogen stores after a workout with sufficient carbohydrate intake is important for muscle recovery, and beginning the next workout with sufficient muscle glycogen stores has been shown to improve exercise performance. [22-24] However, normal dietary intake is typically sufficient to restore muscle glycogen stores after low-intensity exercises, such as walking, yoga, or tai chi (3–5 g carbohydrate/kg body weight per day), and even for moderate-intensity exercise, such as one hour or more of walking, jogging, swimming, or bicycling at modest effort (5–7 g carbohydrate/kg body weight per day). 
            </p> <p>  [24] Post-workout supplementation with carbohydrates and protein within 24–36 hours is only recommended following strenuous 
                physical activity, which includes one hour or more of vigorous exercise such as interval training, running, swimming, 
                bicycling, soccer, or basketball at a moderate to intense effort (where one can only carry on brief conversations or cannot 
                speak); in this case, 6–12 g carbohydrates/kg body weight per day is recommended to be consumed after exercise to fully 
                restore muscle glycogen stores.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Beta_alanine">
            <header>Beta Alanine</header>
            <p>Beta-alanine is an amino acid that is produced in the liver and also found in fish, poultry, and meat. When dosed at 4–6g/day for 2–4 weeks, this supplement has been shown to improve exercise performance, particularly for high-intensity exercise lasting 1–4 minutes, such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or short sprints. It has also been shown to reduce neuromuscular fatigue, particularly in older adults. [5] How does it work? During exercise the body breaks down glucose into lactic acid, which is then converted into lactate. This produces hydrogen ions, which lower muscle pH levels. This acidity reduces muscles’ ability to contract, causing fatigue. [6] Beta-alanine increases muscle concentrations of carnosine, which is a proton buffer that reduces muscle acidity during high-intensity exercise, which in turn reduces overall fatigue. [5] This supplement is often combined with sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda, which also reduces muscle acidity. A common side effect of beta-alanine supplementation is paresthesia, or a skin tingling sensation, [3] but this effect can be attenuated by taking lower doses (1.6g) or using a sustained-release instead of a rapid-release formula. [5] In short, this supplement can help you exercise at high-intensity for a longer period of time, which could potentially lead to increased muscle mass. The International Society of Sports Nutrition has asserted that “beta-alanine supplementation currently appears to be safe in healthy populations at recommended doses,” but it is important to consult with your doctor before beginning supplementation.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="BCAA">
            <header>BCAA</header>
            <p>Three out of the nine essential amino acids have a chemical 
                structure involving a side-chain with a “branch”, or a central carbon atom bound to three or more carbon atoms. 
                These three amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, and valine, are called branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs).  </p>
                   <p> They can be obtained from protein-rich foods such as chicken, red meat, fish, and eggs, and are also sold as dietary 
                    supplements in powdered form. BCAAs are key components of muscle protein synthesis, [41] and research has shown that
                     leucine in particular drives protein synthesis and suppresses protein breakdown. [42-43] Although short-term mechanistic 
                     data suggests that leucine plays an important role in muscle protein synthesis, [44] longer-term trials do not support 
                     BCAAs as useful workout supplements. For example, a trial of leucine supplementation during an 8-week resistance training
                      program did not result in increased muscle mass or strength among participants. [45] Studies have generally failed to 
                      find performance-enhancing effects of BCAAs such as accelerated repair of muscle damage after exercise. [46]</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Creatine">
            <header>Creatine</header>
            <article>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in skeletal muscle that is synthesized in the body from amino acids and can be obtained from red meat and seafood. In the body, it helps produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides energy for muscles. Creatine is a popular workout supplement marketed to increase athletic performance, especially for weight training. Research suggests that creatine supplementation increases muscle availability of creatine, which in turn can enhance exercise capacity and training adaptations in adolescents, younger adults, and older adults. [13] Specifically, these adaptations allow for individuals to increase training volume (e.g., the ability to perform more repetitions with the same weight), which in turn can lead to greater increases in lean mass and muscular strength and power. [14-16] Although the exact mechanisms through which creatine improves performance have not been identified with certainty, various theories have been investigated, including the potential for creatine to stimulate muscle glycogen levels. [17,14] Creatine supplementation is primarily recommended for athletes who engage in power/strength exercises (e.g., weight lifting), or for athletes who engage in sports involving intermittent sprints and other brief repeated high-intensity exercises (e.g., soccer, basketball). </article>

            <header>Glutamine</header>
            <p>Glutamine is important for removing excess ammonia (a common waste product in the body). It also helps your immune system function and may be needed for normal brain function and digestion. You can usually get enough glutamine without taking a supplement because your body makes it and you get some in your diet.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Pre_workout">
            <header>Pre workout</header>
            <p>Pre-workout supplements are designed to provide energy and aid endurance throughout a workout. They are typically taken 15-30 minutes before a workout, but can also be consumed during exercise. Below are common ingredients found in pre-workout supplements that the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine have highlighted as having evidence-based uses in sports nutrition. [3] These supplements have also been categorized as apparently safe and having strong evidence to support efficacy by the International Society of Sports Nutrition. [4] However, it is important to consult a physician or dietitian before using these supplements, as they are not reviewed by the FDA for safety or effectiveness.</p>
